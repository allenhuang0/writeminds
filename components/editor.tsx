        Hi there,
        </h2>
        <p>
        this is a basic <em>basic</em> example of <strong>tiptap</strong>. Sure, there are all kind of basic text styles you’d probably expect from a text editor. But wait until you see the lists:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            That’s a bullet list with one …
        </li>
        <li>
            … or two list items.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Isn’t that great? And all of that is editable. But wait, there’s more. Let’s try a code block:
        </p>
    <pre><code class="language-css">body {
    display: none;
    }</code></pre>
        <p>
        I know, I know, this is impressive. It’s only the tip of the iceberg though. Give it a try and click a little bit around. Don’t forget to check the other examples too.
        </p>
